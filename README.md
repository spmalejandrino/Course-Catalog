# Course-Catalog
The CourseCatalog class reads a set of courses from the file coursedata.txt.  Each course consists of a department, a course number, a credit amount, a competency (W, Q, S, or X), and a group designation (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 0 for no group).  The class provides methods for searching for courses based on specific criterion.
